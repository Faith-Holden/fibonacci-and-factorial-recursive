# fibonacci-and-factorial-recursive

My solution for Chapter  Exercise  of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.

Problem Description:
In many textbooks, the first examples of recursion are the mathematical functions factorial
and fibonacci. These functions are defined for non-negative integers using the following
recursive formulas:
factorial(0) = 1
factorial(N) = N*factorial(N-1) for N > 0
fibonacci(0) = 1
fibonacci(1) = 1
fibonacci(N) = fibonacci(N-1) + fibonacci(N-2) for N > 1
Write recursive functions to compute factorial(N) and fibonacci(N) for a given non-
negative integer N, and write a main() routine to test your functions. Consider using the
BigInteger class (see Exercise 8.2)
(In fact, factorial and fibonacci are really not very good examples of recursion, since
the most natural way to compute them is to use simple for loops. Furthermore, fibonacci
is a particularly bad example, since the natural recursive approach to computing this
function is extremely inefficient.)
